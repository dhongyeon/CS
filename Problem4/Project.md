#### Simulation for Neutrino Oscillations.
* Physics behind Neutrino Oscillation.
There are 3 known flavors for neutrinos. Studies have reported that neutrinos have masses and lepton mixing means that there is some spectrum of the neutrino mass eigenstates. Thus we can express the flavor eigenstates as $$|\nu_{\alpha}\rangle = \sum_{j} U_{\alpha j}^* |\nu_j\rangle$$ The mixing matrix is usually parameterized in the following way, which is the famous PMNS matrix $$U_{\alpha j} = \begin{pmatrix} U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3}\\U_{\mu1} & U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu3} \\ U_{\tau1} & U_{\tau2} & U_{\tau3} \end{pmatrix} $$ $$ = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c_{13} & 0 & s_{13}{e^{-i\delta}} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -s_{13}{e^{i\delta}} & 0 & c_{13} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} e^{i\alpha_1 / 2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\alpha_2 /2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ Just find other references for the physics underlying this phenomena. 

1. Two Neutrino case.
Consider two flavors of the neutrino, and constrain mixing to only happen between each other. Start with an electron neutrino, and plot the oscillation probability with the axis of travel distance. 

2. Three Neutrino case.
Now expand this into the three-neutrion case.
